/*
Event Bubbling and Capturing are two ways of Event Propagation in the HTML, DOM API, when 
an event occurs in an element inside another element and both elements have registered a handle for
that event.
The event propagation determines in which order the elements receive the event.
 It can  be divided into 3 categories
 1. Capture Phase: Going from Window to the Event Target Phase (Top to Bottom)
 2. Target Phase: It is the Target phase.
 3. Bubble Phase: From the event Target to the Window.(Bottom to Top)
